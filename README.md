# Data Stack

Taking recent experiments and applying to data stack.

Main goal is to have a full data lakehouse stack that runs from GitOps. Hoping to learn more about GitOps to start migrating my homelab setup that direction (did some early experiments and got close). Maybe convert to Kubernetes later.
